I am a dedicated, young software developer based in South Florida. I specialize in .NET projects while also being proficient in Java and Python. My knowledge extends to SQL Server, seamless project deployment, and engaging product presentations. In addition, my involvement in competitive programming has led to top 5 finishes in contests all around Florida, further expanding my problem-solving capabilities.

I'm currently working on a simple programming language, soon to be completed.

Along with that, I am also developing a reservation system for my school, to be used next school year.
